                <h3>What can you do?</h3>
                <p>There are things you can do to combat a manipulator, but it may depend on the situation and expectation. You can stand up for yourself and say, "no."
                Sometimes it is a matter of letting the manipulator have what they want if it will help you end the relationship or get away from them immediately.
                A healthy relationship includes both partners making choices and agreeing with each other. 
                Get an idea of what forms of manipulation your partner engages in most often and don't fall for it.
                If you apologize, do so for something you feel is necessary but avoid giving in. If at any time you feel hurt, scared, or threaten, don't hesitate to leave.
                If you can't leave the relationship right away, start planning.</p>  
                <div id="quotes">   
            <p><blockquote> "can happen to the best of us, so don’t feel bad if it happens to you.
                Manipulation does not come with a loud roar, it usually creeps quietly into a room until you are under its spell.
                If this happens to you, don’t feel ashamed, rather acknowledge the manipulation and seek out a counselor for 
                guidance on how to set boundaries to avoid falling into the manipulation trap again.
                It’s definitely doable!" </blockquote> </p>
